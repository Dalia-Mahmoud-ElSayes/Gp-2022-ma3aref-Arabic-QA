"Ma'aref" an Arabic Question Answering on Quran and Fatwa, it 
consists of two parts.


The first part helps people to find an instant answer to their questions in the 
Islamic religion using Fatwa that are collected from valuable resources.


The second part answers questions about Quranic verses by extracting the 
answer from the verses given.
